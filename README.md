# Kucoin-app-Public
IMPORTANT: THE APP DOES NOT SELL OR BUY. ITS ONLY PURPOSE IS TO GIVE AN OVERVIEW TO THE USER <br>
This app uses [Kucoin](https://www.kucoin.com/) API to display helpful information about profits, sell & buy orders, price tracking "watchlist", and sell price to make some profit.<br>
The app is built in python 3 with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) as the front end.

# What is Kucoin
Kucoin is a crypto trading platform. you can find more on their [website](https://www.kucoin.com/)

# Functions
1- a watchlist of some crypto with detailed information about their price movements. <br>

2- Portfolio viewer:
    a- shows all the closed positions <br>
    b- information about unclosed positions like buy price, average profit,...<br>
    c- full view of held crypto with detailed information about the buy price, current value, and most importantly sell price to make some profit <br>
3- Full trading history viewer: allows the user to see all the operations and apply some helpful filter to customize the searching <br>

# Why there is no code?
I chose to not share the code yet because the app is still under testing. Knowing that the financing is a sensitive point, I prefer to have a fully functional app with no bugs before sharing the code "even if the app doesn't do any buy or sell".<br>
If you are interested in testing the app, you can get in touch to discuss how you can provide some help testing the app.
